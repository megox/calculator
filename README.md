# Windows Calculator Clone

A simple project to replicate the design of the classic Windows Calculator using only HTML and CSS. This project demonstrates the use of modern CSS techniques like grid and flexbox, along with an organized approach to dividing complex UIs into smaller, manageable components.

## Features
- **Accurate UI Design**: The calculator interface is a near-exact clone of the original Windows version.
- **Pixel-Perfect Styling**: Colors and dimensions are meticulously matched using external tools like Google Drawing and [Image Color Picker](https://imagecolorpicker.com/).

## Tools & Technologies
